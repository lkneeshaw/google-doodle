March 1, 1872 - Yellowstone becomes world's first national park

## Content

Established by Congress and signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant, on March 1, 1872 Yellowstone became the first national park in the world. It is a huge park, spanning 3,468.4 miles, and has many types of ecosystems. It has lakes, canyons (a Grand Canyon of its own, even!), rivers and mountains, but it is most well known for its geothermal activity, which has created a number of unusual sights. The most famous among them is Old Faithful Geyser, situated next to the lesser known Beehive Geyser. 

It also has hot springs and pools of very unusual colors. These thermal pools spring from deep within the earth, and they get their vivid colors from heat-loving bacteria. The largest of these is the Grand Prismatic Spring. Bright blue ringed by green, yellow and orange, and larger than a football field, it lives up to its name. 

As beautiful as these features are, they're merely symptoms of something larger. Yellowstone sits above the Yellowstone Caldera, the largest supervolcano on the continent. It is considered an active volcano. But that's not so fun to think about, so let's move on!

Yellowstone is also famous for its wildlife. It is home to hundreds of species, most notably grizzly bear, bison, wolves, and elk. The Yellowstone bison herd is the largest public herd of American Bison in the US.
